# Gravity gauntlet

## A Game where the main mechanic is gravity

#### Getting started
you get all the source code avaiable and you just compile it with
`$ make -B`
and that should get you started with playing
please be sure that the shaders folder is in the directory where you're executing it from otherwise it will not work

#### New features and pull requests
if you found any bugs or improvements be sure to make a pull request
if you want any aditional features to the game open an issue and i'll take a look at wether they are featury enough to
implement (so no unnecessary features sadly)

Updates can come at any time so be sure to update your game every few weeks for the latest changes
